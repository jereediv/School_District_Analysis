# School_District_Analysis

The purpose of this project is break down our data so we can see how different schools compare in student performance vs budget, school size, etc. 
Then we will look at how the results differ after replacing the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School.

## Results:

- When looking at the district summary we can see that the overall passing percentage is slightly lower after replacing the 9th grade scores. 
The percentage of students passing reading went up by just over 1% while the percentage passing math dropped about a quarter of a percent.
Interestingly, the average scores for math and reading remained virtually unchanged (math average dropped .06%).

- The school summary shows us that larger budgets do not equate to better grades. We actually see higher performance for schools with less funding per
student. Also, charter schools clearly performed better than the district schools. When looking at the school sizes we can see that large schools
had a significantly lower percentage of students passing math.

- How does replacing the ninth-graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to other schools?
While the passing percentage for reading remained statistically the same, the percetage of students passing math 
fell from 93.27% to 66.91%. The overall passing percentage dropped over 35% after replacing the 9th graders' scores. Thomas High stood out as a top 5
school before replacing the scores. This dropped them down to a somewhat average performer compared to other schools.

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
	- The average math grade was 83.42 and after replacing the 9th grade scores it was 83.35. Average reading grade did not change.
	- Replacing 9th grade scores changed the overall passing percentage significantly. What at first looked like a school doing well with what they had now looks like it is underperforming considering its budget.
	- Scores by school size showed a fairly consistent trend of smaller and middle sized schools performing much better in math than large schools. Thomas High School was a great example of that until we replaced the 9th grade scores. It became an exception to the trend of smaller schools performing better.
	- Scores by school type (charter vs district) show charter schools outperforming district schools accross all metrics. Again, Thomas High became an exception to that when we replaced the 9th grade scores.

## Summary:

The most obvious change we saw when replacing the 9th grade scores was the drop in the percentage of students passing math which dragged down the overall passing percentage substantially. Although not as pronounced, the overall passing percentage accross all schools was dragged down as a result. However the average reading score accross schools remained the same and average math score dropped only slightly. Percentage passing reading actually increased accross the board from 85.81% to 86.83%. Replacing the scores clearly hurt the results for Thomas High and to a lesser extent, the averages that include all schools.
